# NetBanking System (Java)

This is my college mini-project for a NetBanking application. 
It is built using Java Swing for the UI and SQLite for the database.

## Features
- User login and registration
- Check balance and profile
- Transfer money to other accounts
- Add beneficiaries
- View transaction history
- Fixed deposit calculator & booking
- Bill payments
- Complaint box

## How to run
1. Include the `sqlite-jdbc.jar` and `slf4j-api` jars in your classpath.
2. Compile and run `com.netbanking.main.NetBankingApp`.
3. The database `netbanking.db` will be created automatically on the first run.

## Demo Users
- `meiy` / `meiy123`
- `hari` / `hari123`
- `sugan` / `sugan123`
